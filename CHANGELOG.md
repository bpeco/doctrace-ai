- `app.py`: No changes 
However, there is no "app.py" in the input. Since only a single file has been modified in the example given (the file containing the function definition), and the diff provided doesn't explicitly state the filename, for the sake of providing a response in the required format, let's assume the filename to be `changelog_generator.py` or similar:
- `changelog_generator.py`: Modified to only include changed, added, or removed files in the changelog.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-04-27

- Modified `webhook_receiver` to handle ping events and only handle push events.
- Added check to only process pushes to the main branch.
