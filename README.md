# Doctrace-AI 🧠

Doctrace-AI is an AI-powered tool that generates changelog entries automatically based on Git commit diffs. It listens for GitHub webhooks and updates your repository with the generated documentation.

## 🔧 Pipeline

- Merge your feature branch into `main`  
- Webhook detects the push to `main` and appends a new entry under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`  
- A fresh branch (`auto/docs-XXXX`) is created from `main` containing the updated changelog  
- A PR is opened from `auto/docs-XXXX` back to `main`  
- When that PR is merged, a webhook converts `## [Unreleased]` into `## YYYY-MM-DD` (today’s date) and resets an empty `## [Unreleased]` section  
- The release bump is committed and pushed automatically

## 🚀 Features

- **GitHub webhooks**  
  - **push** to `main` → generates `## [Unreleased]` entry and opens an auto-PR  
  - **pull_request** merged from `auto/docs-…` → converts `## [Unreleased]` into `## YYYY-MM-DD`  
- **Diff parsing** using GitPython  
- **Automated changelog** generation in [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) style  
- **Automatic PRs** to keep your `CHANGELOG.md` always up-to-date  
- **Fully automated release versioning** workflow

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.12**  
- **FastAPI** – webhook receiver & HTTP API  
- **GitPython** – diff parsing and Git operations  
- **OpenAI API** – text generation for changelog entries  
- **Poetry** – dependency management  
- **Docker** (optional)  

## 📝 TO DO

- Prevent double creation of `auto/docs-…` branches: ensure only one autogenerated branch is created per push to `main`.
