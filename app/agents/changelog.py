    Given a unified diff, produce a Keep-a-Changelog formatted entry (date + bullet list) summarizing the changes under the [Unreleased] section.
    Perform the task following these instructions:
    1- Include each change as a bullet starting with the filename in backticks, followed by a colon and a concise summary of **what changed**.
    2- If a hunk consists only of re-formatted lines or whitespace changes, omit it from the changelog.
    3- Only include the files that have been changed, added, or removed. If a file has not been changed, added, or removed, do not include it in the changelog.
    4- No preamble, no explanation, just the entry.

    Here is the actual unified diff on which you need to perform this task:
